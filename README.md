How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?<br />
The easiest way to interpret user needs is to create user stories. An example is as follows:<br />
As a [type of user], I want to [function] so that [result].<br />
User stories serve as a communication tool between customers and the development team. They allow the team to organize tasks by priority.<br />
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?<br />
I believe the best approach to programming is to break down the project into smaller, more manageable sections. Using the Agile method, I would focus on delivering a functional program by the end of each sprint. I would also focus on continuous improvement and collaboration with the rest of the development team.<br />
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?<br />
A good development team member must be open to communication and collaboration with the rest of the development team. They should also be able to take accountability for delivering a product that satisfies customer requirements. Lastly, a good team member must be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements or any additions to the workload.
